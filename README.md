# We are Flant

Being around since 2008, [Flant](https://flant.com/company/about-us) is a Kubernetes Certified Service Provider that offers [DevOps-as-a-Service](https://flant.com/services/devops-as-a-service) and [Managed Kubernetes](https://flant.com/services/managed-kubernetes-as-a-service).

**Open Source is our strong passion** and fundament that powers the company from its inception. That’s why we’re extremely happy to share our own Open Source solutions with a wider DevOps/Kubernetes community.

Here are the most noticeable projects created in Flant and available on GitHub:

*   [**werf**](https://github.com/werf/werf) _(moved to a separate GitHub organization)_ — a powerful CI/CD tool to glue Git, Docker, container registry, your existing CI system, Helm and Kubernetes.
*   [**shell-operator**](https://github.com/flant/shell-operator) — a handy tool to easily create your Kubernetes operator using scripts (Bash, Python, etc.) or any binaries;
*   [**addon-operator**](https://github.com/flant/addon-operator) — an older brother of shell-operator extending its features with Helm charts that makes it a mighty system to manage additional components in your Kubernetes clusters in a consistent & automated way;
*   [**grafana-statusmap**](https://github.com/flant/grafana-statusmap) — our Grafana panel plugin to visualize status of multiple objects over time;
*   [**k8s-image-availability-exporter**](https://github.com/flant/k8s-image-availability-exporter) — a Prometheus exporter to warn you proactively about images that are defined in Kubernetes objects but are not available in the container registry.

Surely, **we are always happy to see your issues & PRs**!
